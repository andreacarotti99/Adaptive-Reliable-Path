# Adaptive Reliable Path
- Implementation in Python of the E2EA adaptive reliable path
- Designed for enhancing network reliability. Focused on minimizing disconnections, it dynamically adapts to network changes, ensuring uninterrupted end-to-end communication.
- The algorithm optimizes network paths by continuously assessing and adapting to network reliability. Its online approach ensures the most stable connection between any two points in a network.
